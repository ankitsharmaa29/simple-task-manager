Dashboard:
A user-friendly dashboard displays tasks, categorized into upcoming, overdue, and completed sections for quick access.

Task Management:
Users can effortlessly add, edit, or delete tasks, with each task containing a title, description, due date, and priority level.

Priority Levels:
Three task priority levels are availableâ€”High, Medium, and Lowâ€”allowing users to set and adjust task urgency as needed.

Search and Filter:
A search bar and filters enable users to locate tasks swiftly, with options to filter by priority or completion status.

# Tech Stack

Libraries: uuid for unique task IDs, react-icons for icons

# Assumptions
