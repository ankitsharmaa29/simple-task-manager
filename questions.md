1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
   I spent approximately 2-3 hours on the coding test, including time for planning, coding, and final review. My focus was on implementing clean, efficient solutions while ensuring code readability and accuracy. This duration allowed me to complete the test within the specified requirements while verifying each solution’s correctness.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
   In JavaScript, the recent introduction of optional chaining (?.) is incredibly useful for simplifying code by handling undefined or null values gracefully.

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
   To track down production performance issues, I’d analyze application logs, monitor metrics (CPU, memory, request time), and use tools like New Relic or Datadog. Analyzing slow database queries or heavy API calls helps identify bottlenecks. I’ve handled production issues by logging critical events and analyzing their root causes, improving both server-side and client-side response times.

4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
   With more time, I’d add user authentication, a drag-and-drop interface for task prioritization, and recurring task scheduling. Additionally, I’d implement persistent storage (e.g., Firebase or local storage) for tasks, ensuring they are retained across sessions. Enhancing UI/UX with animations and more comprehensive filtering options would further improve usability and functionality.
